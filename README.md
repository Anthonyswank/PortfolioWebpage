#Anthony Swank's Portfolio

My Portfolio Webpage for Thinkful course. This includes the css and html files, as well as my images, for the portfolio module 
of the Thinkful course. I think I did pretty well putting it together and am eager to see the response I get on it.

This is the version of my portfolio after day 2 submitting before day 3. Added html forms, navigation bar, and tweaked/fixed parts
of my html and css code.
